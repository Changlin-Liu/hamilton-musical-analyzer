How does the bastard orphan
Immigrant decorated war vet
Unite the colonies through more debt
Fight the other founding fathers til he has to forfeit
Have it all lose it all
You ready for more yet
Treasury Secretary Washingtons the President
Evry American experiment sets a precedent
Not so fast Someone came along to resist him
Pissed him off until we had a twoparty system
You havent met him yet you havent had the chance
cause hes been kickin ass as the ambassador to France
But someones gotta keep the American promise
You simply must meet Thomas Thomas
