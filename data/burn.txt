[eliza] i saved every letter you wrote me from the moment i read them i knew you were mine you said you were mine i thought you were mine do you know what angelica said when we saw your first letter arrive she said be careful with that one love he will do what it takes to survive you and your words flooded my senses your sentences left me defenseless you built me palaces out of paragraphs you built cathedrals im rereading the letters you wrote me im searching and scanning for answers in every line for some kind of sign and when you were mine the world seemed to burn burn you published the letters she wrote you you told the whole world how you brought this girl into our bed in clearing your name you have ruined our lives do you know what angelica said when she read what youd done she said you have married an icarus he has flown too close to the sun you and your words obsessed with your legacy your sentences border on senseless and you are paranoid in every paragraph how they perceive you you you you im erasing myself from the narrative let future historians wonder how eliza reacted when you broke her heart you have torn it all apart i am watching it burn watching it burn the world has no right to my heart the world has no place in our bed they dont get to know what i said im burning the memories burning the letters that might have redeemed you you forfeit all rights to my heart you forfeit the place in our bed you sleep in your office instead with only the memories of when you were mine i hope that you burn
