PHILIP:
Meet the latest graduate of Kings College!
I probly shouldnt brag, but, dag, I amaze and astonish!
The scholars say I got the same virtuosity and brains as my pops!
The ladies say my brains not where the resemblance stops!
Im only nineteen but my mind is older
Gotta be my own man, like my father, but bolder
I shoulder his legacy with pride
I used to hear him say
That someday
I would—

ENSEMBLE:
Blow us all away

PHILIP:
Ladies, Im lookin for a Mr. George Eacker
Made a speech last week, our Fourth of July speaker
He disparaged my fathers legacy in front of a crowd
I cant have that, Im making my father proud

MARTHA:
I saw him just up Broadway a couple of blocks
He was goin to see a play

PHILIP:
Well, Ill go visit his box

DOLLY:
God, youre a fox

PHILIP:
And yall look pretty good in ya frocks
How ‘bout when I get back, we all strip down to our socks?

BOTH:
Ok!

COMPANY:
Blow us all away!

PHILIP:
George!

GEORGE:
Shh

PHILIP:
George!

GEORGE:
Shh! Im tryin to watch the show!

PHILIP:
Ya shoulda watched your mouth before you
Talked about my father though!

GEORGE:
I didnt say anything that wasnt true
You fathers a scoundrel, and so, it seems, are you

ENSEMBLE:
Ooooooooooh!

PHILIP:
Its like that?

GEORGE:
Yeah, I dont fool around
Im not your little schoolboy friends

PHILIP:
See you on the dueling ground
That is, unless you wanna step outside and go now

GEORGE:
I know where to find you, piss off
Im watchin this show now

PHILIP:
Pops, if you had only heard the shit he said about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about to—

HAMILTON:
Slow down

PHILIP:
I came to ask you for advice. This is my very first duel
They dont exactly cover this subject in boarding school

HAMILTON:
Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?

PHILIP:
He refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease

HAMILTON:
Where is this happening?

PHILIP:
Across the river, in Jersey

HAMILTON/PHILIP:
Everything is legal in New Jersey…

HAMILTON
Alright. So this is what youre gonna do:
Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you
When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air
This will put an end to the whole affair

PHILIP:
But what if he decides to shoot? Then Im a goner

HAMILTON:
No. Hell follow suit if hes truly a man of honor
To take someones life, that is something you cant shake
Philip, your mother cant take another heartbreak

PHILIP:
Father—

HAMILTON:
Promise me. You dont want this
Young mans blood on your conscience

PHILIP:
Okay, I promise

HAMILTON:
Come back home when youre done
Take my guns. Be smart. Make me proud, son

PHILIP:
My name is Philip
I am a poet
Im a little nervous, but I cant show it
Im sorry, Im a Hamilton with pride
You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide
Mister Eacker! How was the rest of your show?

GEORGE:
Id rather skip the pleasantries
Lets go
Grab your pistol

PHILIP:
Confer with your men
The duel will commence after we count to ten

ENSEMBLE:
Count to ten!

PHILIP:
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then slowly and clearly aim your gun towards the sky—

MALE ENSEMBLE:
One two three four

FULL ENSEMBLE:
Five six seven
