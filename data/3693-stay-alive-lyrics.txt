ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN

HAMILTON
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes George attack the British forces
I shoot back we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment assistance
They only take British money so sing a song of sixpence

WASHINGTON
The cavalrys not coming

HAMILTON
Sir

WASHINGTON
Alex listen Theres only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage outright

HAMILTON
Thats right

WASHINGTON
Dont engage strike by night
Remain relentless ˜til their troops take flight

HAMILTON
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

WASHINGTON
Outrun

HAMILTON

LAFAYETTE

LAURENS
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every days a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

HAMILTON
We cut supply lines we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And evry day
Sir entrust me with a command
And evry day

WASHINGTON
No

HAMILTON
He dismisses me out of hand

LAFAYETTE
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

HAMILTON
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin this to anybody who would listen

LEE
