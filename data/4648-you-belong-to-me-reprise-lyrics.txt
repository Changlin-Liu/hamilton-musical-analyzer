[Sara]
Hand in hand to the park
New day with my family
Her favorite playground
He was waiting
I am the dark and I'm falling
Don't go to the bar when its closing
And I will be waiting, ready and waiting

Forsaken, fooled, and fooled again
Open your hope to love and then
Like Bruce and that damn Madeline
They think they can return to when they were younger
Like life was better
Clubs and diamonds, spades and hearts
Can‘t choose our roles just play our parts
Here's the ground and here's your spade
Tend the garden, dig the grave

[Michael]
Right now I feel like I could do anything I wanna do
If you will notice I'm a
I am a man in disguise
If you will notice I'm a
I am a man

Waiting here at the bar
Barmaid says he'll be right in
I picture her on her knees
In front of him
The things she's done to him
I held hold a glass in hand
I grip it so hard I wanna feel it crack
but sharpen the shatterings
and I'm waiting
I sit here waiting

I wanna watch them bleed
I want to black out every lie
And end this all
I use my imagination
I walk on in it
broken glass
throats are slashed
Their blood splattered on the wall

[Sara]
Thought he could play with me
In front of my little girl
But playtime is over
I'm not playing, I'm done playing
I wanna watch him bleed
I want to black out every lie
and end this all
use my imagination
I walk on in it
broken glass
throat is slashed
His blood splattered on the wall

[Tom]
Right now I feel like I could do anything I wanna do
If you will notice I'm a
I am a man in disguise
If you will notice I'm a
I am a man

[Quartet]
You belong to me
I'll never let you go
No no, this time I won't
lose you
you will never go away
Don't talk to me 'cause
You're mine
 I'm yours
 I will do anything at all

[Sara]
Feel like a cat in a fishbowl

[Tom]
Feel like a dog in the boneyard

[Tom and Michael]
He's gonna pay for what he stole

[Quartet]
I'm gonna get
I'm gonna get
I'm gonna get
Even

[Thanks to Sheila for lyrics]
