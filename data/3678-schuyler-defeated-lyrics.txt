Our senator

Burr
Since when are you a DemocraticRepublican

BURR
Since being one put me on the up and up again

HAMILTON
No one knows who you are or what you do

BURR
They dont need to know me
They dont like you

HAMILTON
Excuse me

BURR
Oh Wall Street thinks youre great
Youll always be adored by the things you create
But upstate

HAMILTON
Wait

BURR
people think youre crooked
Schuylers seat was up for grabs so I took it

HAMILTON
Ive always considered you a friend

BURR
I dont see why that has to end

HAMILTON
You changed parties to run against my fatherinlaw

BURR
I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw
I swear your pride will be the death of us all
Beware it goeth before the fall
