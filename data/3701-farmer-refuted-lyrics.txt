SEABURY:
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury, and I present 
"Free thoughts on the proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interest at heart

MULLIGAN: Oh my god. Tear this dude apart

SEABURY:
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Dont let them lead you astray
This congress does not speak for me

BURR: Let him be

SEABURY:
Theyre playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame!

HAMILTON: Yo!

SEABURY:

SEABURY &amp; HAMILTON:
Scream—

HAMILTON:
Honestly, look at me, please dont read!

SEABURY: Not your interest—

HAMILTON:
Dont modulate the key then not debate with me 
Why should a tiny island across the sea
Regulate the price of tea?

BURR: Alexander, please!

HAMILTON:
Burr, Id rather be divisive than indecisive
Drop the niceties

ENSEMBLE:
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!
FULL COMPANY:
A message from the King!
