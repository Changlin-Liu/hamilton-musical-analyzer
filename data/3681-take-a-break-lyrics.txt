HAMILTON:
My dearest, Angelica
“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day”
I trust youll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
Im a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain
Madison is Banquo, Jeffersons Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

HAMILTON &amp; ANGELICA:
And there you are, an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
I cannot put the notion away…

ELIZA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
I am on my way

ELIZA:
Theres a little surprise before supper
And it cannot wait

HAMILTON:
Ill be there in just a minute, save my plate

ELIZA:
Alexander

HAMILTON:
Okay, okay

ELIZA:
Your son is nine years old today
Has something hed like to say
Hes been practicing all day
Philip, take it away

PHILIP:
Daddy, daddy, look
My name is Philip
I am a poet
I wrote this poem just
To show it
And I just turned nine
You can write rhymes
But you cant write mine

HAMILTON:
What!

PHILIP:
I practice French
And play piano with my mother

HAMILTON:
Uh-huh!

PHILIP:
I have a sister, but I want a little brother

HAMILTON:
Okay!

PHILIP:
My daddys trying to start Americas bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq!      
 
HAMILTON:
Bravo!
 
ELIZA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
Hey, our kid is pretty great

ELIZA:
Run away with us for the summer
Lets go upstate

HAMILTON:
Eliza, Ive got so much on my plate

ELIZA:
We can all go stay with my father
Theres a lake I know…

HAMILTON:
I know

ELIZA:
In a nearby park

HAMILTON:
Id love to go

ELIZA:
You and I can go when the night gets dark…

HAMILTON:
I will try to get away

ANGELICA:
My dearest Alexander
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Dont stop ‘til you agree
Your favrite older sister
Angelica, reminds you
Theres someone in your corner all the way across the sea

In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and youve consumed my waking days
It says:

HAMILTON &amp; ANGELICA:
“My dearest Angelica”

ANGELICA:
With a comma after “dearest.” Youve written

HAMILTON AND ANGELICA:
“My dearest, Angelica.”

ANGELICA:
Anyway, all this to say
Im coming home this summer
At my sisters invitation
Ill be there with your famly
If you make your way upstate
I know youre very busy
I know your works important
But Im crossing the ocean and I just cant wait

HAMILTON AND ANGELICA:
You wont be an ocean away
You will only be a moment away…

ELIZA:
Alexander, come downstairs. Angelicas arriving today! Angelica!

ANGELICA:
Eliza!

HAMILTON:
The Schuyler sisters!

ANGELICA:
Alexander

HAMILTON:
Hi

ANGELICA:
Its good to see your face

ELIZA:
Angelica, tell this man John Adams spends the summer with his family

HAMILTON:
Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesnt have a real job anyway

ANGELICA:
…youre not joining us? Wait

HAMILTON:
Im afraid I cannot join you upstate

ANGELICA:
Alexander, I came all this way

ELIZA:
She came all this way

ANGELICA:
All this way

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
You know I have to get my plan through Congress

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Run away with us for the summer
Lets go upstate

HAMILTON:
I lose my job if I dont get my plan through Congress

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
We can all go stay with our father

ELIZA:
Theres a lake I know

ANGELICA:
I know Ill miss your face

ELIZA:
In a nearby park

ANGELICA:
Screw your courage to the sticking place

ELIZA:
You and I can go

ANGELICA:
Elizas right

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
Take a break and get away

ANGELICA:
Run away with us for the summer

ELIZA:
Lets go upstate
Where we can stay

ANGELICA:
We can all go stay with our father
If you take your time

ELIZA:
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now

ANGELICA:
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream

ELIZA:
We can go

ELIZA AND ANGELICA:
When the night gets dark
Take a break.

HAMILTON:
I have to get my plan through Congress
I cant stop until I get this plan through Congress
