Hamilton the Musical - The Schuyler Sisters Lyrics




"The Schuyler Sisters" is a song from the Broadway musical Hamilton performed by Renée Elise Goldsberry , Phillipa Soo , Leslie Odom Jr. , Peggy.


BURR:
Theres nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slumming it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk at the students in the common
Just to watch ‘em talk

Take Philip Schuyler, the man is loaded
Uh oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at

COMPANY: Work, work
ANGELICA: Angelica!
COMPANY: Work, work
ELIZA: Eliza!
PEGGY: And Peggy!
COMPANY: Work, work
The Schuyler sisters

ANGELICA: Angelica!
PEGGY: Peggy!
ELIZA: Eliza!
COMPANY: Work!

PEGGY: Daddy said to be home by sundown
ANGELICA: Daddy doesnt need to know
PEGGY: Daddy said not to go downtown
ANGELICA: Like I said, youre free to go

But—look around, look around
The revolutions happening in New York
ELIZA &amp; PEGGY: New York
COMPANY: Angelica
SISTERS &amp; COMPANY: Work!

PEGGY: Its bad enough Daddy wants to go to war
ELIZA: People shouting in the square
PEGGY: Its bad enough therell be violence on our shore
ANGELICA: New ideas in the air

ANGELICA &amp; MALE ENSEMBLE: Look around, look around—

ELIZA: Angelica, remind me what were looking for

ALL MEN: Shes looking for me!

ANGELICA:
Eliza, Im looking for a mind at work 
Im looking for a mind at work  [x2]
Woa-oah
SISTERS: Woa-oah
SISTERS &amp; COMPANY: Work!

BURR:
Ooh, theres nothing like summer in the city
Someone in a rush meets someone looking pretty
Excuse me, miss, I know its not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddys got money
Why you slummin in the city in your fancy heels?
You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?

ANGELICA: Burr, you disgust me

BURR:
Ahh, so youve discussed me
Im a trust fund, baby, you can trust me

ANGELICA:
Ive been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
So men say that Im intense or Im insane
You want a revolution? I want a revelation
So listen to my declaration:

ALL SISTERS:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal"

ANGELICA:
And when I meet Thomas Jefferson 
Imma compel him to include women in the sequel

WOMEN: Work!

ELIZA:
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now
ELIZA, PEGGY:
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now
ALL SISTERS:
History is happening in Manhattan and we
Just happen to be in the greatest city in the world

SISTERS &amp; COMPANY: In the greatest city in the world!
