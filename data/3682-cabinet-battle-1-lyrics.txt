WASHINGTON
Ladies and gentlemen you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight 
but youre here with us in New York City 
Are you ready for a cabinet meeting

The issue on the table Secretary Hamiltons plan to assume state debt
and establish a national bank 
Secretary Jefferson you have the floor sir

JEFFERSON
˜Life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
We fought for these ideals; we shouldnt settle for less
These are wise words enterprising men quote ˜em
Dont act surprised you guys cuz I wrote ˜em

JEFFERSON &amp; MADISON
Oww

JEFFERSON
But Hamilton forgets
His plan would have the government assume states debts
Now place your bets as to who that benefits
The very seat of government where Hamilton sits

HAMILTON
Not true

JEFFERSON
Ooh if the shoe fits wear it
If New Yorks in debt
Why should Virginia bear it Uh Our debts are paid Im afraid
Dont tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade
In Virginia we plant seeds in the ground
We create You just wanna move our money around
This financial plan is an outrageous demand
And its too many damn pages for any man to understand
Stand with me in the land of the free
And pray to God we never see Hamiltons candidacy
Look when Britain taxed our tea we got frisky
Imagine what gon happen when you try to tax our whisky

WASHINGTON
Thank you Secretary Jefferson Secretary Hamilton your response

HAMILTON
Thomas That was a real nice declaration
Welcome to the present were running a real nation
Would you like to join us or stay mellow
Doin whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello
If we assume the debts the union gets
A new line of credit a financial diuretic
How do you not get it If were aggressive and competitive
The union gets a boost Youd rather give it a sedative
A civics lesson from a slaver Hey neighbor
Your debts are paid cuz you dont pay for labor
We plant seeds in the South We create
Yeah keep ranting
We know whos really doing the planting
And another thing Mr Age of Enlightenment
Dont lecture me about the war you didnt fight in it
You think Im frightened of you man
We almost died in a trench
While you were off getting high with the French
Thomas Jefferson always hesitant with the President
Reticentthere isnt a plan he doesnt jettison
Madison youre mad as a hatter son take your medicine
Damn youre in worse shape than the national debt is in
Sittin there useless as two shits
Hey turn around bend over Ill show you
Where my shoe fits

WASHINGTON
