Theres nothing like summer in the city
Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty
Theres trouble in the air you can smell it
And Alexanders by himself Ill let him tell it

HAMILTON
I hadnt slept in a week
I was weak I was awake
You never seen a bastard orphan
More in need of a break
Longing for Angelica
Missing my wife
Thats when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life she said

MARIA
I know you are a man of honor
Im so sorry to bother you at home
But I dont know where to go and I came here all alone

HAMILTON
She said

MARIA
My husbands doin me wrong
Beatin me cheatin me mistreatin me
Suddenly hes up and gone
I dont have the means to go on

HAMILTON
So I offered her a loan I offered to walk her home she said

MARIA
Youre too kind sir

HAMILTON
I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away
She lived a block away she said

MARIA
This ones mine sir

HAMILTON
Then I said well I should head back home
She turned red she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said

MARIA
Stay

HAMILTON
Hey

MARIA
Hey

HAMILTON
Thats when I began to pray
Lord show me how to
Say no to this
I dont know how to
Say no to this

But my God she looks so helpless
And her bodys saying hell yes

MARIA
Whoa

HAMILTON

HAMILTON AND ENSEMBLE
Say no to this

HAMILTON

HAMILTON
I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time It became a pastime
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr James Reynolds even better it said

JAMES
Dear Sir I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me down on their luck
You see that was my wife who you decided to

HAMILTON
Fuuuu

JAMES
Uhoh You made the wrong sucker a cuckold
So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey you can keep seein my whore wife
If the price is right if not Im telling your wife

HAMILTON
I hid the letter and I raced to her place
Screamed How could you in her face
She said

MARIA
No sir

HAMILTON
Half dressed apologetic A mess she looked
Pathetic she cried

MARIA
Please dont go sir

HAMILTON
So was your whole story a setup

MARIA

HAMILTON

MARIA

HAMILTON
