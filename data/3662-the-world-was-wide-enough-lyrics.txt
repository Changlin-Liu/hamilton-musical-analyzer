BURR AND COMPANY
Number two

Hamilton arrived with his crew
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew

COMPANY
Number three

BURR
I watched Hamilton examine the terrain
I wish I could tell you what was happning in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits

COMPANY
Most disputes die and no one shoots
Number four

BURR
Hamilton drew first position
Looking to the world like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksmans ability
The doctor turned around so he could have deniability

COMPANY

COMPANY
Number eight

BURR AND HAMILTON AND ENSEMBLE MEN
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds see if they can set the record straight

BURR
They wont teach you this in your classes
But look it up Hamilton was wearing his glasses
Why If not to take deadly aim
Its him or me the world will never be the same
I had only one thought before the slaughter
This man will not make an orphan of my daughter

COMPANY
Number nine

BURR
Look him in the eye aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

COMPANY
One two three four five six seven eight nine
Number ten paces Fire

HAMILTON
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
Is this where it gets me on my feet sevral feet ahead of me
I see it coming do I run or fire my gun or let it be
There is no beat no melody
Burr my first friend my enemy
Maybe the last face I ever see
If I throw away my shot is this how youll remember me
What if this bullet is my legacy

Legacy What is a legacy
Its planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
America you great unfinished symphony you sent for me
You let me make a difference
A place where even orphan immigrants
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
Im running out of time Im running and my times up
Wise up Eyes up
I catch a glimpse of the other side
Laurens leads a soldiers chorus on the other side
My son is on the other side
Hes with my mother on the other side
Washington is watching from the other side

Teach me how to say goodbye

Rise up rise up rise up
Eliza

My love take your time
Ill see you on the other side
Raise a glass to freedom

BURR AND COMPANY
He aims his pistol at the sky

BURR
Wait

BURR
I strike him right between his ribs
I walk towards him but I am ushered away
They row him back across the Hudson
I get a drink

COMPANY

BURR AND ANGELICA
Angelica and Eliza

BURR
Were both at his side when he died
Death doesnt discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
History obliterates
In every picture it paints
It paints me and all my mistakes
When Alexander aimed
At the sky
He may have been the first one to die
But Im the one who paid for it

I survived but I paid for it

Now Im the villain in your history
I was too young and blind to see
I shouldve known
I shouldve known
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
