HAMILTON:
Mr. President, you asked to see me?

WASHINGTON:
I know youre busy

HAMILTON:
What do you need, sir? Sir?

WASHINGTON:
I wanna give you a word of warning

HAMILTON:
Sir, I dont know what you heard
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it

WASHINGTON:
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning

HAMILTON:
Youre kidding

WASHINGTON:
I need a favor

HAMILTON:
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior

WASHINGTON:
Shh. Talk less

HAMILTON:
Ill use the press
Ill write under a pseudonym, youll see what I can do to him

WASHINGTON:
I need you to draft an address

HAMILTON:
Yes! He resigned. You can finally speak your mind

WASHINGTON:
No, hes stepping down so he can run for President

HAMILTON:
Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir

WASHINGTON:
Im stepping down. Im not running for President

HAMILTON:
Im sorry, what?

WASHINGTON:
One last time
Relax, have a drink with me
One last time
Lets take a break tonight
And then well teach them how to say goodbye
To say goodbye
You and I

HAMILTON:
No, sir, why?

WASHINGTON:
I wanna talk about neutrality

HAMILTON:
Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time

WASHINGTON:
I want to warn against partisan fighting

HAMILTON:
But—

WASHINGTON:
Pick up a pen, start writing
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard-won wisdom I have earned

HAMILTON:
As far as the people are concerned
You have to serve, you could continue to serve

WASHINGTON:
No! One last time
The people will hear from me
One last time
And if we get this right
Were gonna teach ‘em how to say
Goodbye
You and I

HAMILTON:
Mr. President, they will say youre weak

WASHINGTON:
No, they will see were strong

HAMILTON:
Your position is so unique

WASHINGTON:
So Ill use it to move them along

HAMILTON:
Why do you have to say goodbye?

WASHINGTON:
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
It outlives me when Im gone
Like the scripture says:
“Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid.”
Theyll be safe in the nation weve made
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade
At home in this nation weve made
One last time

HAMILTON:
One last time

HAMILTON:
Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, 
I am unconscious of intentional error, 
I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think 
it probable that I may have committed many errors. 
I shall also carry with me

HAMILTON &amp; WASHINGTON:
The hope

HAMILTON:
That my country will

HAMILTON &amp; WASHINGTON:
View them with indulgence;

HAMILTON:
And that

HAMILTON &amp; WASHINGTON:
After forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal

HAMILTON:
The faults of incompetent abilities will be

HAMILTON &amp; WASHINGTON:
Consigned oblivion, as I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which 
I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking, 
in the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws
Under a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart, 
and the happy reward, as I trust
Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.

WASHINGTON:
One last time

ALL WOMEN:
George Washingtons going home!

HAMILTON:
Teach ‘em how to say goodbye

COMPANY:
George Washingtons going home

WASHINGTON:
You and I

COMPANY:
George Washingtons going home

WASHINGTON:
Going home

COMPANY:
George Washingtons going home

WASHINGTON:
History has its eyes on you

COMPANY:
George Washingtons going home

WASHINGTON:                           COMPANY:
Were gonna teach ‘em how to
Say goodbye!                             Teach ‘em how to say goodbye!
Teach ‘em how to
Say goodbye!                             Teach ‘em how!
To say goodbye!
.                                               Say goodbye!
Say goodbye!
.                                               Say goodbye!
One last time!
.                                               One last time!
