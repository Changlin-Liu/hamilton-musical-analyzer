BURR:
How does Hamilton,
the short-tempered, protean creator
of the coast guard,
founder of the New York Post
ardently abuse his cabinet post
destroy his reputation?
Welcome folks, to the Adams Admistration.
Jeffersons the runner-up
which makes him the vice-president,

MADISON:
Washington cant help you now,
no more Mr. nice President

BURR:
Adams fires Hamilton,
Privatley calls him creole bastard in his toss

Hamilton publishes his response.

HAMILTON:
Sit down John,
you fat mother-fucker.

JEFFERSON:
Hamiltons out of control,

MADISON:
This is great:
Hes out of power,
he holds no office
and he just destroyed president John Adams
the only other significant member of his party

JEFFERSON:
Hamilton is a host unto himself,
as long as he can hold a pen,
hes a threat.
Lets let him know what we know.
