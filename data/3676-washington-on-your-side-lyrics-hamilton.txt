OUT!

[Bridge: Chorus]
OH! This immigrant isnt somebody we chose!
OH! This immigrants keeping us all on our toes!
OH! Lets show these Federalists what theyre up against!
OH! Southern motherfucking  Democratic-Republicans!
OH! Lets follow the money and see where it goes!
OH! Because every second, the treasury grows!
OH! If we follow the money and see where it leads
Get in the weeds, look for the seeds of Hamiltons misdeeds!

[Outro: Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr and James Madison ]
It must be nice, it must be nice… 
Follow the money and see where it goes! 
It must be nice, it must be nice… 
The emperor has no clothes
We wont be invisible
We wont be denied! 
Still… 
It must be nice, it must be nice 
To have Washington on your side
