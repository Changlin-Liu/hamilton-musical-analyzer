ANGELICA
I remember that night I just might regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream that you cant quite place
but Alexander Ill never forget the first time I saw your face
I have never been the same Intelligent eyes in a hungerpang frame 
And when you said Hi I forgot my dang name set my heart aflame evry part aflame
FULL COMPANY
This is not a game¦
HAMILTON
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
ANGELICA
Im sure I dont know what you mean You forget yourself
HAMILTON
Youre like me Im never satisfied
ANGELICA
Is that right
HAMILTON
I have never been satisfied
ANGELICA
My name is Angelica Schuyler
HAMILTON
Alexander Hamilton
ANGELICA
Wheres your famly from
HAMILTON
Unimportant Theres a million things I havent done but just you wait just you wait¦
ANGELICA
So so so so this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level 
What the hell is the catch Its the feeling of freedom of seein the light 
its Ben Franklin with a key and a kite You see it right The conversation lasted two minutes 
maybe three minutes evrything we said in total agreement its a dream and its a bit of a dance 
a bit of a posture its a bit of a stance Hes a bit of a flirt but Im ˜a give it a chance 
I asked about his famly did you see his answer His hands started fidgeting he looked askance 
Hes penniless hes flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome boy does he know it Peach fuzz and he cant even grow it 
I wanna take him far away from this place then I turn and see my sisters face and she is
ELIZA
Helpless¦
ANGELICA
And I know she is
ELIZA
Helpless¦
ANGELICA
And her eyes are just¦
ELIZA
Helpless¦
ANGELICA
And I realize
ANGELICA AND COMPANY
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time¦
HAMILTON
Where are you taking me
ANGELICA
Im about to change your life
HAMILTON
Then by all means lead the way
COMPANY 
Number one
ANGELICA
Im a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich 
My father has no sons so Im the one who has to social climb for one 
so Im the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in New York City is insidious 
Alexander is penniless Ha That doesnt mean I want him any less
ELIZA
Elizabeth Schuyler Its a pleasure to meet you
HAMILTON
Schuyler
ANGELICA
My sister
COMPANY
Number two
ANGELICA
Hes after me cuz Im a Schuyler sister That elevates his status Id have to be naÃ¯ve to set that aside 
maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza now thats his bride 
Nice going Angelica he was right You will never be satisfied
ELIZA
Thank you for all your service
HAMILTON
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet it will have been worth it
ANGELICA
Ill leave you to it
COMPANY
Number three
ANGELICA
I know my sister like I know my own mind you will never find anyone as trusting or as kind 
If I tell her that I love him shed be silently resigned hed be mine She would say Im fine
ANGELICA AND COMPANY
Shed be lying
ANGELICA
But when I fantasize at night its Alexanders eyes 
as I romanticize what might have been if I hadnt sized him up so quickly 
At least my dear Elizas his wife; at least I keep his eyes in my life¦
