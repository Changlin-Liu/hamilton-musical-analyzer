[Intro Thomas Jefferson ]
The Election of 1800
Can we get back to politics
Please
Yo¦

[Verse 1 Thomas Jefferson]
Every action has its equal opposite reaction
John Adams shat the bed; I love the guy but hes in traction
Poor Alexander Hamilton he is missing in action
So now Im facing Aaron Burr with his own faction

[James Madison]
Hes very attractive in the North New Yorkers like his chances

[Jefferson]
Hes not very forthcoming on any particular stances

[Madison]
Ask him a question it glances off he obfuscates he dances

[Jefferson]
And they say Im a Francophile at least they know I know where France is

[Madison]
Thomas thats the problem; see they see Burr as a less extreme you
You need to change course a key endorsement might redeem you

[Jefferson]
Who did you have in mind

[Madison]
Dont laugh

[Jefferson]
Who is it

[Madison]
You used to work on the same staff

[Jefferson]
Whaaaat

[Hook 1 Thomas Jefferson and James Madison]

[Madison]
It might be nice it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

[Jefferson and Madison]
It might be nice it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

[Break Aaron Burr]
Talk less 
Smile more 
Don\'t let them know what you\'re against or what you\'re for 
Shake hands with him 
Charm her 
Its 1800; ladies tell your husbands vote for Burr

[Verse 2 Various Ensemble]
I dont like Adams Well hes gonna lose thats just defeatist
And Jefferson In love with France Yeah hes so elitist
I like that Aaron Burr I cant believe were here with him
He seems approachable Like you could grab a beer with him

[Bridge 1  &amp; Ensemble]
Dear Mr Hamilton
Your fellow Federalists would like to know how youll be voting

Dear Mr Hamilton
John Adams doesnt stand a chance so who you are you promoting

Jefferson or Burr Jefferson or Burr
We know its lose/lose
Jefferson or Burr Jefferson or Burr
But if you had to choose¦
Dear Mr Hamilton
John Adams doesnt stand a chance so who you are you promoting
But if you had to choose

[Verse 3 Alexander Hamilton &amp; Aaron Burr]

[Hamilton]
Well if isnt Aaron Burr sir

[Burr]

[Hamilton]
Youve created quite a stir sir

[Burr]
Im going door to door


[Hamilton]
Youre openly campaigning

[Burr]

[Hamilton]
Thats new

[Burr]
Honestly its kind of draining


[Hamilton]
Burr

[Burr]
Sir

[Hamilton]
Is there anything you wouldnt do

[Burr]
No Im chasing what I want and you know what

[Hamilton]
What

[Burr]
I learned that from you

[Bridge 2 James Madison Thomas Jefferson]



[Madison]
¦Its a tie



[Jefferson]
Its up to the delegates




[Jefferson and Madison]
Its up to Hamilton





[Verse 4 Alexander Hamilton]
Yo
 The people are asking to hear my voice
 But the country is facing a difficult choice
 And you were to ask me who Id promote¦
 ¦Jefferson has my vote
 I have never agreed with Jefferson once¦
 We have fought on like 75 different fronts
 But when all said and all is done¦
Jefferson has beliefs; Burr has none

[Hook 2 Thomas Jefferson Aaron Burr James Madison]


[Jefferson and Madison]
Well Ill be damned Well Ill be damned

[Madison]
Hamiltons on your side



[Madison]
And¦ you won in a landslide

[Burr]
Congrats on a race well won
I did give you a fight

[Jefferson]
Uhhuh¦

[Burr]
I look forward to our partnership

[Jefferson]
Our partnership

[Burr]
As your vice president

[Jefferson]
[laughs] Yeah right

[Outro Thomas Jefferson and James Madison]

[Jefferson]
You hear this guy
Man openly campaigns against me talking ˜bout I look forward to our partnership

[Madison]
It is crazy that the guy who comes in second gets to be vice president

[Jefferson]
OOOH Yknow what we can change that Yknow why

[Madison]
Why

[Jefferson]
˜Cause Im the president
Burr¦
When you see Hamilton thank him for the endorsement
