HAMILTON:
In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

When I was seventeen a hurricane
Destroyed my town
I didnt drown
I couldnt seem to die

I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see
I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me

They passed a plate around
Total strangers
Moved to kindness by my story
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York bound…

I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution
I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance

In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

I was twelve when my mother died
She was holding me
We were sick and she was holding me
I couldnt seem to die

BURR:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it…

HAMILTON:
Ill write my way out…

BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it…

HAMILTON:
Write evrything down, far as I can see…

BURR AND ENSEMBLE:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait…

WASHINTON, ELIZA, ANGELICA &amp; MARIA:
History has its eyes on you.

HAMILTON:
Ill write my way out…
Overwhelm them with honesty.

HAMILTON:
This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only
Way I can protect my legacy…

COMPANY :
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait…
