ANGELICA
There are moments that the words dont reach
There is suffering too terrible to name
You hold your child as tight as you can
And push away the unimaginable
The moments when youre in so deep
It feels easier to just swim down

ANGELICA AND ENSEMBLE
The Hamiltons move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable

HAMILTON
I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And its quiet uptown
I never liked the quiet before
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before

ANGELICA AND WOMEN
If you see him in the street walking by
Himself talking to himself have pity

HAMILTON
Philip you would like it uptown
Its quiet uptown

ANGELICA AND WOMEN
He is working through the unimaginable

ALL MEN 
His hair has gone grey He passes every day
They say he walks the length of the city

HAMILTON
You knock me out I fall apart

COMPANY 
Can you imagine

HAMILTON
Look at where we are
Look at where we started
I know I dont deserve you Eliza
But hear me out That would be enough

If I could spare his life
If I could trade his life for mine
Hed be standing here right now
And you would smile and that would be enough
I dont pretend to know
The challenges were facing
I know theres no replacing what weve lost
And you need time
But Im not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
That would be enough

COMPANY 
If you see him in the street walking by her
Side talking by her side have pity

HAMILTON
Eliza do you like it uptown Its quiet uptown

COMPANY 
He is trying to do the unimaginable
See them walking in the park long after dark
Taking in the sights of the city

HAMILTON
Look around look around Eliza

COMPANY 
They are trying to do the unimaginable

ANGELICA
There are moments that the words dont reach
There is a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we can never understand
We push away the unimaginable
They are standing in the garden
Alexander by Elizas side
She takes his hand

ELIZA
Its quiet uptown

COMPANY 
Forgiveness Can you imagine
Forgiveness Can you imagine
If you see him in the street walking by her
Side talking by her side have pity
They are going through the unimaginable
